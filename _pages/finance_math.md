### The Mathematics of Stock Prices
---

The S&P 500 index is a bellweather index for the U.S. equity market consisting of 505 consitutent companies.<br>
Below I show summary statistics describing the nature of S&P 500 index prices and returns.<br><br>
Note that the monthly prices (a discrete time series) seem to follow a lognormal distribution, having a minimum price of $0. 
Monthly total returns, which are the first difference of the monthly price series, seem to approximate a normal distribution.<br><br><br>
