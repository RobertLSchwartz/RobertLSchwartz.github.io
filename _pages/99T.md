### 99 Tartans Angel Syndicate
---
#### Who We Are
99T is an angel syndicate of Carnegie Mellon University alumni who invest in alumni-founded startups. The objective is to generate strong returns for syndicate members who invest in early-stage ventures, while also supporting the advancement of the Carnegie Mellon entreprenurial ecosystem.

#### Investment Criteria
Criteria for investment include, but are never limited to:
1. a CMU founder or co-founder
2. an open round with a committment from an institutional VC
3. a negotiated term sheet
4. existing revenue, letters of intent, or other proof of product-market fit

Successful companies are typically those with a strong management team, a scalable product or service, and a large addressable market. Prior institutional investors, strategic investors, value-added partnerships, and Board members or advisors with industry experience are usually a plus. During the due diligence phase we will typically solicit an updated pitch deck, a copy of the institutional term sheet, historical company financials, pro forma financials, and a recent cap table.

#### How We Invest
Investments are typically made at the pre-seed, seed, or Series A stage with subsequent follow-on investments thereafter. Commonly utilized investment vehicles are the Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), convertible note, and preferred stock.  All 99 Tartans syndicate members have accredited status under SEC guidelines. All investments are pooled and made through an SPV structure to maximize efficiency and scalability of capital deployment.

#### Portfolio Companies
Examples of companies currently or formerly invested in by various members of the 99 Tartans syndicate include the following. Many of these ventures are tremendous examples of the entreprenurial spirit and capacity for innovation in the Greater Pittsburgh region.
