### 99 Tartans Angel Syndicate
---

99T is an angel syndicate of Carnegie Mellon University alumni who invest in Carnegie Mellon alumni-founded startups. Investments are typically made at the pre-seed, seed, or Series A stage with subsequent follow-on investments thereafter. Criteria for investment include, but are never limited to: (1) a CMU founder or co-founder, (2) an open round with a committment from an institutional VC and associated term sheet, and (3) existing revenue, letters of intent, or other proof of product-market fit. Successful companies are typically those with a strong management team, a scalable product or service, and a large addressable market. Prior institutional investors, strategic investors, value-added partnerships, and Board members or advisors with industry experience are usually a plus.
