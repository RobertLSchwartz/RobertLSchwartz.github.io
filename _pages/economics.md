<h2> What I'm Reading </h2>
When I read something particularly rewarding I like to share. All of the files below are already freely available on the internet. I'm purely curating them in a centralized place based on what I see as valuable reading material. Feel free to browse. If you enjoyed something, send me a note on LinkedIn! <br>

#### Counterpoint Global Insights
Michael Mauboussin is Head of Consilient Research for Counterpoint Global over at Morgan Stanley. I find this articles to be fantastic because they take finance theory and integrate it into practical reality. If you are taking graduate-level finance courses, I'd recommend reading these articles alongside your coursework. <br>
