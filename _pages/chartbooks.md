#### Chartbooks
Below are a series of chartbooks spanning macroeconomics and capital markets. They are meant to serve as a long-term historical perspective. Most of the charts I have created using third-party data, such as from the Federal Reserve Economic Database, Bureau of Economic Analysis, SIFMA, Bloomberg, etc. I provide no guarantee of data accuracy. Some data is periodically updated to reflect minor changes by the data providers. For example, sometimes economic data is revised. I made best efforts to only use the "final" version of each data series instead of "preliminary". Nevertheless, I cannot provide assurance that there are no errors, omissions, or subsequent updates to the data after the charts have been created. I update the chartbooks once per year. I do not share underlying data files. All charts are meant for educational purposes only.
