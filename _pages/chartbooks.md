### My Chartbooks
Below are a series of chartbooks spanning macroeconomics and capital markets. They are meant to serve as a long-term historical perspective. Most of the charts I have created using third-party data, such as from the Federal Reserve Economic Database, Bureau of Economic Analysis, SIFMA, Bloomberg, etc. I provide no guarantee of data accuracy. Some data is periodically updated to reflect minor changes by the data providers. For example, sometimes economic data is revised. I make best efforts to only use the "final" version of each data series instead of "preliminary". Nevertheless, I cannot provide assurance that there are no errors, omissions, or subsequent updates to the data after the charts have been created. I publish updated chartbooks once per year. I do not share underlying data files. All charts are meant for educational purposes only.<br>

### Third Party Chartbooks
Below are several third-party chartbooks available online free of charge. JP Morgan offers the Guide to the Markets, which pairs well with David Kelly's Notes on the Week Ahead podcast. The National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) - in partnership with PitchBook - issues a wonderful quarterly chartbook covering venture equity and venture debt. For broad capital market trends, SIFMA is an excellent resource.<br>
