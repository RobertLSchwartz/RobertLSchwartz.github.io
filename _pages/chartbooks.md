#### Chartbooks
Below are a series of chartbooks containing economic and capital market data. They are meant to serve as a long-term historical perspective. Most of the charts I have created using third-party data, such as from the Federal Reserve Economic Database, Bureau of Economic Analysis, SIFMA, Bloomberg, etc. I provide no guarantee of data accuracy. Some data is periodically updated to reflect minor changes by the data providers. For example, sometimes economic data is revised. I made best efforts to only use the "final" version of each data series instead of "preliminary". Nevertheless, I cannot provide assurance they no errors, omissions, or subsequent updates to the data have occured. This data is meant for educational purposes only.

1. Equity Risk Premiums & Credit Spreads
2. Capital Market Returns
3. Credit Issuance
4. M&A and IPOs
5. Oil Markets
6. Macroeconomic Data
7. Company Fundamentals
