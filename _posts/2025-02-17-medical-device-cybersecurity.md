#### Supply Chain Risks in Tangible and Intangible Goods Markets
In the world of manufacturing, companies that process and assemble final products sold into the goods market are routinely concerned about their physical supply chains for intermediate inputs used in the production process. Vulnerabilities at any stage of the supply chain can result in serious detrimental business outcomes. For example, if one supplier is the cause of shipment delays or goods defects, the manufacturing company will be subject to throughput interruptions, idle capacity, and an overall decline in manufacturing output, all of which manifests itself in the form of higher cost and lower revenue thereby eating into profits. Although it may not be well known, the same concerns are often shared by software vendors, who are often subject to a supply chain of intangible intermediate inputs necessary for the software development process. In fact, it is estimated that most software in use today relies heavily on open-source software and publicly available libraries. While the proliferation of shared software in the public domain is a major benefit to society at large, it does pose significant cybersecurity risks. But the danger does not stop there. Software vendors also frequently license third-party proprietary software for inclusion in their final software products sold to end users. The end result is an assembled piece of software, analogous to a tangible manufactured product, which is the sum of its parts. The principal risk often overlooked due to its ambiguity and complexity is the chance that one or more underlying components of the overall software are susceptible to cybersecurity threats.

The problem faced by end users of software is that they traditionally have limited to no visibility into the underlying components, or supply chain, being employed. Think of it this way. If a grocery store is notified by a product manufacturer that their meat is being recalled due to a health safety concern, grocery stores across the country can quickly and effectively pull those specific items off the shelves. From a software perspective, if an open-source or third-party licensed piece of code used in the software itself becomes infected with a cybersecurity threat, the end user of the software lacks the necessary visibility into the software supply chain to know what their level of exposure it. A classic example is the healthcare industry. Ransomware distributors have been targeting healthcare providers for a number of years through software vulnerabilities within durable medical devices and other critical healthcare infrastructure. The canonical examples is WannaCry, which was deployed by a state-owned agent as a form of untraditional warfare against the United States. These cybersecurity vulnerabilities embedded in healthcare infrastructure pose a substantial risk to patient safety and risk the lives of innocent civilians. If hospitals cannot use their digital systems, often the best-case scenario is they have to move patients elsewhere, redirecting them to neighboring facilities. If people cannot get the medical care they need quickly, the cost can be life and death.
