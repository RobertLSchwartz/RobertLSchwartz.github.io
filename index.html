<b> Welcome </b> <br>
Hello! My name is Robert Schwartz. I'm currently an MBA student at the Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business. I'm also an Associate Portfolio Manager at Federated Hermes.<br><br>

<b> Work Life </b> <br>
As an APM, I co-manage roughly $1.3bn in AUM across 10+ taxable fixed income SMA strategies. These strategies offer clients exposure to the taxable fixed income universe - i.e.
U.S. investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, U.S. government bonds, agency bonds, RMBS, CMBS, ABS, and international bonds.<br><br>

<b> Academic Life </b> <br>
My undergraduate studies took place at the Indiana University of PA, where I majored in Finance and Legal Studies. I also took courses focused
on applied statistics and econometrics. Finding enjoyment in the application of statistics to economic and finance topics, I coauthored my first (mediocre) paper,
which was presented at the American Economic Association conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Board of Philadelphia. Subsequently, I went on to coauthor
two publications researching the performance of hedge funds.

Now pursuing my graduate degree at Carnegie Mellon, I intend to deepen my knowledge with an emphasis on economics, corporate finance, and data science applications to capital markets.<br><br>
