<h4> Welcome </h4> <br>
Hello! My name is Robert Schwartz. I'm currently an MBA student at the Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business.
I'm also an Associate Portfolio Manager at Federated Hermes. <br><br>

<h4> Work Life </h4> <br>
As a portfolio manager in the fixed income world, I co-manage ~$2 billion in assets across 10+ separately managed account ("SMA") strategies.
These strategies are used by financial advisers across the U.S. to fulfill taxable fixed income mandates for their clients.
My professional expertise lies in investment-grade corporate bonds, U.S. government bonds, and agency bonds.
However, I do have proficiency in managing portfolio exposures to HY corporate bonds, international bonds, MBS, and ABS. <br><br>

<h4> Academic Life </h4> <br>
My undergraduate studies took place at the Indiana University of PA, where I earned my B.S. in Finance and Legal Studies. I also
took courses focused on applied statistics and econometrics. Finding enjoyment in the application of statistics to economic
and finance topics, I coauthored my first paper, which was presented at the American Economic Association conference
hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Subsequently, I went on to coauthor two publications researching the
performance of hedge funds. Pursuing my graduate degree at Carnegie Mellon, I intend to expand my understanding of
macroeconomics, corporate finance, and data science.<br><br>
