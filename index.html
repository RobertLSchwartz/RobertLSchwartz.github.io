<b> Welcome </b> <br>
Hello! My name is Robert Schwartz. I'm currently an MBA student at the Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business.
I'm also an Associate Portfolio Manager at Federated Hermes and purported wizard in the kitchen. <br><br>

<b> Work Life </b> <br>
As a portfolio manager in the fixed income world, I co-manage ~$1.3 billion in assets across 10+ separately managed account ("SMA") strategies.
These strategies are used by financial advisers across the U.S. to fulfill their clients taxable fixed income needs.
My professional expertise lies in investment-grade corporate bonds, U.S. government bonds, and agency bonds.
However, I do have proficiency in managing portfolio exposures to HY corporate bonds, international bonds, MBS, and ABS. <br><br>

<b> Academic Life </b> <br>
My undergraduate studies took place at the Indiana University of PA, where I earned my B.S. in Finance and Legal Studies. I also
took courses focused on applied statistics and econometrics. Finding enjoyment in the application of statistics to economic
and finance topics, I coauthored my first paper, which was presented at the American Economic Association conference
hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Subsequently, I went on to coauthor two publications researching the
performance of hedge funds. Pursuing my graduate degree at Carnegie Mellon, I intend to expand my understanding of
macroeconomics, corporate finance, and data science.<br><br>

<b> Interests </b> <br>
My interests tend to be quite broad. As a result, I often find myself to be a bit of a generalist in most subjects.
From a research perspective, I am becoming increasingly interested in whether the findings of past studies continue to hold true
under evolving market conditions, monetary regimes, and payment systems. Take asset pricing and monetary policy as two examples.
Less formally, I've found myself gravitating towards subjects like national economic security and U.S. economic history. Personally,
I am quite the foodie and a bit of a movie fanatic.<br><br>
